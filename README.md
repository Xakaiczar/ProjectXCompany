# Project X-Company
Hi! This project is based off the course _Unity Turn-Based Strategy Game: Intermediate C# Coding_ by GameDevTV and CodeMonkey ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-turn-based-strategy/) / [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-turn-based-strategy/)). In this course, the instructors cover some intermediate Unity / C# techniques - such as events and delegates - while creating a squad-based strategy game, similar to X-COM or Final Fantasy Tactics. I originally started this course about a year ago, but lost the motivation to continue as I found myself constantly refactoring and rewriting code. This time, I will be working on both their solution _and_ my own solution at the same time.

The code will be written under two separate namespaces: GameDevTV (GDTV) and X-Company (XCOM). The former will encapsulate the original tutorial as a reference for myself if I need it during development, while the latter will include my own implementation of their suggested features. Hopefully, this will make each version of the code much easier to maintain. I don't want a repeat of last time... (trust me, it was a mess!)

The rest of this readme will act as a devlog-type document, explaining the purpose of each commit and the features added. I will also use that space to explain the differences between my implementation and GDTV's original vision, as well as the logic behind my choices. So let's hope my decisions are, in fact, logical!

So, without further ado, it's time to crack on!
