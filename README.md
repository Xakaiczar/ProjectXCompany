# Project X-Company
Hi! This project is based off the course _Unity Turn-Based Strategy Game: Intermediate C# Coding_ by GameDevTV and CodeMonkey ([Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/unity-turn-based-strategy/) / [GameDevTV](https://www.gamedev.tv/p/unity-turn-based-strategy/)). In this course, the instructors cover some intermediate Unity / C# techniques - such as events and delegates - while creating a squad-based strategy game, similar to X-COM or Final Fantasy Tactics.

I originally started this course about a year ago, but lost the motivation to continue as I found myself constantly refactoring and rewriting code. This time, I will be working on both their solution _and_ my own solution at the same time.

I will follow a fairly rigid workflow to ensure I'm making the most of both solutions:
1. At the start of the lecture, the instructor will open with the lecture aims and objectives. I will first attempt to complete those objectives using only that opening brief, as if I have been given a task by my lead to be completed independently.
2. After that, I will follow along with their implementation, both as a learning exercise and for later reference if I need it.
3. Finally, if on reflection I feel like I can improve my solution using the lecturer's solution, I will do so.

Following this pattern, each lecture will be split into 2 or 3 separate commits, all of which will be listed in a respective log file (see below).

The code will be written under two separate namespaces: GameDevTV (GDTV) and X-Company (XCOM). The former will encapsulate the original tutorial, while the latter will include my own implementation of their suggested features. Hopefully, this will make each version of the code much easier to maintain. I don't want a repeat of last time... (trust me, it was a mess!)

## Logs
Below are links to my logs, explaining the code written and the features added. I will also use that space to explain the differences between my implementation and GDTV's original vision, as well as the logic behind my choices. So let's hope my decisions are, in fact, logical!

All logs can be found in [this](https://github.com/Xakaiczar/ProjectXCompany/tree/main/Devlog) folder, or you can navigate via the list of links below!
